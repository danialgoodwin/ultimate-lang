# Design Decision - Assignment Operator

The main choices for an assignment operator are `=` or `:` or `:=` or `assign` (or synonym) or nothing. Examples:
- `a = 1` in B, C, C++, Go, Hascal, Haxe, Java, Javascript, Kotlin, Matlab, Python, Ruby, Rust, SQL
- `a: 1`
- `a := 1` in Ada, Pascal
- `assign a 1`
- `set a 1`
- `(setf a 1)` in Lisp
- `alias a 1`
- `a 1`
- `a -> 1`

The most common assignment operator by far is `=`.


TODO: Add the languages that are using each operator.
