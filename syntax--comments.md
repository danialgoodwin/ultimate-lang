## Single-line comments
Prefer not (in order of worse to less-worse:
- `'` because it will be used as syntax for text
- `--` because it is the common syntax for decrement
- `` ` `` because it is the common syntax for Markdown 'code' 
- `//` because `/` is used for division. Some languages use `//` for `mod` (Python)
    - Also, all other arithmetic is already used doubled: `**` being used for exponents, `++` for increment, `--` for decrement
- `#` because it is a good syntax for Markdown ordered lists
- `@` because not easy to reach? because it is used to mean 'annotation' in other languages
- `;` because it is common syntax for ending a statement (useful for the times of putting multiple statements on one line). Good for comment syntax because easy to reach. But, could we have this easy key for something used more often?
- `;;` because (see `;`). This is better than `;` because `;;` isn't used in regular English sentences.



## Multi-line comments
Prefer not (in order of worse to less-worse:
- from `/*` to `*/`
- from `;;;` to `;;;` because different and (see `;`) and wordy(?). Possible pro: Similar to the `;;` comment syntax
- from `[*` to `*]` because different
